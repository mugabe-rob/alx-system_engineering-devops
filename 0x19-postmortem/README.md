Title: Web Stack Outage Postmortem: Slow Database Responses Impacting User Experience
Issue Summary
On November 15, 2022, from 13:30 PM to 17:00 PM, our web application experienced a partial outage due to slow database responses. Approximately 60% of active users encountered delayed page loads and intermittent errors while accessing their accounts. The root cause was identified as a spike in database connections combined with insufficient query optimization.

Timeline:
13:30 PM: Monitoring alerts triggered for increased response times and error rates
13:35 PM: Our infrastructure engineering team acknowledged the alerts and initiated investigations
13:45 PM: Preliminary analysis pointed towards potential issues within the database layer
14:05 PM: Assumptions focused on high resource usage; no significant misconfigurations found
14:25 PM: Escalation to senior DBA for further assistance
15:00 PM: Root cause confirmed â€“ excessive unoptimized queries leading to connection pool saturation
15:15 PM: Implemented immediate fixes to optimize critical queries and increase connection limits
16:00 PM: Performance stabilized; reverted temporary changes after confirming improvement
17:00 PM: System returned to normal operation levels; closed incident

Root Cause and resolution
The primary reason behind the outage was a sudden surge in complex, poorly-optimized database queries, resulting in connection pool exhaustion. As more users accessed the platform during peak hours, the number of concurrent requests overwhelmed the available connections. This resulted in degraded performance and occasional failures when attempting new connections. To resolve the situation, we executed the following actions:

Identified and prioritized the top five most frequently run but underperforming queries
Optimized those problematic queries using various techniques such as index tuning and caching strategies
Increased MySQL's max_connections parameter temporarily to accommodate higher demand

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To improve our systems and minimize the likelihood of similar occurrences, we recommend implementing the following corrective and preventative measures:

Establish a regular process for reviewing and analyzing slow-running SQL statements across all applications
Develop automated tools for detecting and reporting suboptimal queries based on predefined criteria
Enhance monitoring capabilities around database connections, including real-time notifications upon reaching certain thresholds
Investigate auto-scaling options to dynamically allocate additional resources during periods of heavy load
Schedule periodic training sessions for developers to emphasize best practices regarding efficient data retrieval and manipulation
Encourage collaboration between development teams and DBAs early in the software design phase to ensure scalability requirements are met consistently
